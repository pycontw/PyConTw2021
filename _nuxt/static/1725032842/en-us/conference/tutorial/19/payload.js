But for many developers, they remain somewhat mysterious and intimidating. In this tutorial, you'll learn what decorators are, how they work, how to write them, and when you should use them. Along the way, you'll write a bunch of decorators that will demonstrate their power.";b.detailed_description="This tutorial will walk people through the writing and usage of decorators, one step at a time:\r\n\r\n- First, we'll go through a scenario involving two existing functions whose output we want to change identically. We'll end up understanding what decorators do, and what their syntax really means behind the scenes.\r\n- Then we'll talk about where decorators are used, understanding the roles of the outer and inner functions. We'll then practice with a function-timing logger.\r\n- Then we'll talk about how the outer function, while only run once, sticks around as a closure, and can thus be used for storage and caching by the inner function. We'll even implement a simple caching system (memoization) using a decorator, and will discuss where and how it would fail.\r\n- Next, we'll look at how we can use a decorator to filter and modify inputs and outputs to a function.\r\n- Finally, we'll look at how we can write a decorator that takes arguments (i.e., triply-nested functions), why it works that way, and where we might use them.\r\n\r\nI'm confident (having taught this many times before) that people will come out of this tutorial with a much better understanding of decorators, how to use them, and what's involved.";b.slide_link=a;b.slido_embed_link=a;b.hackmd_embed_link=a;b.speakers=[{thumbnail_url:"https:\u002F\u002Ftw.pycon.org\u002Fprs\u002Fmedia\u002Fcache\u002Fa1\u002Fb5\u002Fa1b59885025365453010497e0e846ecb.jpg",name:"Reuven M.
