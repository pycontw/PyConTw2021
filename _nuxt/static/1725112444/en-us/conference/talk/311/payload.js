Once we know the secret, we will guide you in building a custom linter using this module. This technique is particularly useful when configuring existing tools that cannot fix your style problems or if you want to make your Python code unpythonic. Join us to learn more and bring chaos to the Python world!";b.detailed_description="Key takeaways:\r\n\r\n- Learn how code analysis tools work behind the scenes.\r\n- Discover how to create a custom linter that can be used in legacy codebases, project-specific conventions, or integration requirements with external systems.\r\n\r\nThis talk is perfect for those interested in Python internals or needing a customized linter to reduce review effort.";b.slide_link=a;b.slido_embed_link=a;b.hackmd_embed_link=a;b.speakers=[{thumbnail_url:"https:\u002F\u002Ftw.pycon.org\u002Fprs\u002Fmedia\u002Fcache\u002F4a\u002F4b\u002F4a4b9520c35c314b7d9c1c33dd5c4ac3.jpg",name:"李唯 (Wei Lee)",github_profile_url:"https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002FLee-W",twitter_profile_url:"https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002Fclleew",facebook_profile_url:a,bio:"Wei Lee is an open-source ethicist.
