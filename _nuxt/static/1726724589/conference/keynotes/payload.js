In this talk, we will explore the basics of audio processing using Python from a data science perspective. We will discuss the characteristics of time-domain data, important mathematical tools, and artificial intelligence related to audio. Additionally, we will focus on how to use these tools to handle complex musical and biological signals. Finally, we aim to present the multifaceted nature of contemporary music AI research, covering applications from music generation and human-computer interaction in music to the study of musical cultural heritage.\r\n\r\nSince most current AI applications focus on text and image processing, I believe there will be significant interest in the applications and principles of audio processing.

The ubiquity of open source software hasn’t gone unnoticed, there are new threats looking to exploit open source projects to achieve their goals. In this talk we’ll learn about these threats to the software supply chain, the efforts to thwart them, and the steps we can take to keep the Python ecosystem safe for everyone.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this talk is to describe the current threat landscape for open source projects like CPython and packages on the Python Package Index (PyPI), and what recent projects have done to mitigate these threats. My second year as Security Developer-in-Residence will be focusing on improving the security posture of the ecosystem of Python packages and the downstream users who consume those projects, so this keynote will cover that work along with any announcements, achievements, etc. I plan on weaving my background and experience with internet technology and security into the narrative of supply chain security.","https:\u002F\u002Fapp.sli.do\u002Fevent\u002F6vbzEFpSNtNoqEDk3uppmw","https:\u002F\u002Fhackmd.io\u002F@pycontw\u002FBkz6D5lpR",{},{},{},"https:\u002F\u002Fapp.sli.do\u002Fevent\u002F6hDE1PTLbaY6Fi9Z84LaGj","https:\u002F\u002Fhackmd.io\u002F@pycontw\u002Fr1NcDcxa0",{},{},"Georgi Ker","Georgi Ker is the Director and a Fellow of the Python Software Foundation.
