Ensuring the accuracy and reliability of data through effective validation and ETL data pipeline (Extract, Transform, Load) testing is paramount. \r\n\r\nI will introduce the essentials of data validation and ETL data pipeline testing, highlighting processes, types, and best practices. We'll explore frameworks like Great Expectations and dbt to automate and enhance data testing. \r\n\r\nThis talk is designed to equip data engineers and scientists with the knowledge to implement robust data validation strategies, understand the nuances of ETL testing, and maintaining good data quality, and ensuring data pipelines are error-free and efficient.",detailed_description:"The talk will begin by emphasizing that Data Quality, Data Contracts, and Test Strategy are the foundation of effective data management.\r\n\r\nIn the session \"Frameworks Unveiled: Tools for Ensuring Data Quality,\" two data testing frameworks will be introduced, highlighting how the right choice can boost the efficiency, accuracy, and reliability of data validation. Clear data contracts and a solid test strategy are key to consistently maintaining data quality.\r\n\r\nThe session will conclude by stressing the importance of selecting the right framework, establishing data contracts, and implementing a robust test strategy. Participants will be encouraged to see these tools as essential for fostering innovation and excellence within their teams. \r\n\r\nFrameworks in this talk:\r\n*  [Great Expectations](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fgreat-expectations\u002Fgreat_expectations) \r\n*  [dbt test](https:\u002F\u002Fdocs.getdbt.com\u002Freference\u002Fcommands\u002Ftest)\r\n*  [dbt contracts](https:\u002F\u002Fdocs.getdbt.com\u002Fdocs\u002Fcollaborate\u002Fgovern\u002Fmodel-contracts)\r\n*  More frameworks:\r\n    *  [Soda](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fsodadata\u002Fsoda-core)\r\n    *  [Pandera](https:\u002F\u002Fpandera.readthedocs.io\u002Fen\u002Fstable\u002F)\r\n    *  [Fugue](https:\u002F\u002Ffugue-tutorials.readthedocs.io\u002F)",slide_link:"https:\u002F\u002Fspeakerdeck.com\u002Fsucitw\u002Fensuring-data-integrity-with-validation-and-pipeline-testing",slido_embed_link:"https:\u002F\u002Fapp.sli.do\u002Fevent\u002F8B4BwuE4pwcDXzD2PHCG3d",hackmd_embed_link:"https:\u002F\u002Fhackmd.io\u002F@pycontw\u002FSJcAP5lT0",speakers:[{thumbnail_url:"https:\u002F\u002Ftw.pycon.org\u002Fprs\u002Fmedia\u002Fcache\u002F0e\u002Fb7\u002F0eb74e292a2bcb6be9519c8d76faae30.jpg",name:"Shuhsi Lin",github_profile_url:a,twitter_profile_url:"https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002FShuhsiLin",facebook_profile_url:a,bio:"Experienced professional with a proven track record in designing scalable and robust data architectures and fostering a strong engineering culture. \r\n\r\nSkilled in leading high-performance teams to deliver effective data solutions using DataOps principles. \r\n\r\nCurrently focused on enhancing developer experience in  a smart manufacturing and AI department"}],event_type:"talk"}}],fetch:{},mutations:[]}}("")));
