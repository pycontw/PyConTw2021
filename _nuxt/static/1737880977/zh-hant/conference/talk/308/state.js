This talk introduces an innovative approach to revolutionizing technical documentation through implementing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities of Amazon Bedrock. We will explore how RAG can dynamically update knowledge bases by retrieving relevant information from a variety of data sources and walk through how to implement such a solution to ensure that technical documentation remains accurate, comprehensive, and reflective of the latest advancements within the codebase and the organization.",detailed_description:"In the rapidly evolving tech industry, maintaining up-to-date and comprehensive technical documentation is a challenge for many organizations. This session introduces an innovative solution to this problem by leveraging the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities of Amazon Bedrock, a service that simplifies the development of generative AI applications by providing access to a wide range of foundation models (FMs).\r\n\r\nWe will delve into how Amazon Bedrock's RAG functionality can be utilized to create dynamic knowledge bases for technical documentation. RAG enhances the generative AI process by fetching relevant information from specified data sources and incorporating this data into the generation prompts, ensuring that the content is both accurate and up-to-date. This approach significantly improves the relevance and quality of the generated documentation, making it a valuable tool for technical writers and documentation teams.\r\n\r\nThe presentation will provide a comprehensive guide on integrating RAG with your technical documentation workflow, starting from choosing the right foundation model from Amazon Bedrock, to setting up data sources, and finally, to generating and updating documentation content. Participants will learn how to use Python to interact with Amazon Bedrock's APIs for efficient data retrieval and content generation, all within their existing AWS infrastructure.\r\n\r\nA key part of the session will be a live demonstration of a documentation generation system that utilizes RAG to pull the most current information from a company's code repositories, product manuals, and internal wikis. This system ensures that the generated documentation is not only accurate but also reflects the latest changes and updates in the technology or product it describes.\r\n\r\nThis talk is designed for technical writers, documentation specialists, and developers interested in leveraging the latest advancements in AI to enhance their documentation processes. Attendees will gain practical insights into how RAG and Amazon Bedrock can be applied to create self-updating, accurate knowledge bases that serve as a single source of truth for technical documentation.\r\n\r\nBy the end of this session, you will have a clear roadmap for integrating RAG into your technical documentation workflow, enabling you to produce high-quality, dynamic content that keeps pace with technological advancements. Discover how to revolutionize your documentation process with the power of generative AI and Amazon Bedrock.",slide_link:d,slido_embed_link:"https:\u002F\u002Fapp.sli.do\u002Fevent\u002Fi4Kg63rnH6xsiNs4rBn4KA",hackmd_embed_link:"https:\u002F\u002Fhackmd.io\u002F@pycontw\u002FHJOsD5gaC",speakers:[{thumbnail_url:"https:\u002F\u002Ftw.pycon.org\u002Fprs\u002Fmedia\u002Fcache\u002F17\u002F5a\u002F175a2df648b4361f9522148f3624f054.jpg",name:"Renaldi Gondosubroto",github_profile_url:"https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Frenaldig",twitter_profile_url:"https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002FRenaldig",facebook_profile_url:d,bio:"Renaldi Gondosubroto is the Director of Cloudetica Solutions, where he leads the building of both proprietary and open-source solutions on cloud platforms.
