Do you aim to present research findings vividly through visualizations? Want to deliver actionable insights to stakeholders in an interactive format?\r\n\r\nOften, we are stuck using one technology stack\u002Fframework\u002Fsolution because it's what we're used to or it's what's available. But this limits us. It stops us from deeply understanding how to solve problems or trying out new ideas.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we'll see how we can break free from these limits when it comes to building Data Dashboards. Using a dataset of visitors to Taiwan, we'll explore different tools and frameworks so as to choose the best one for each job.\r\n\r\nWe'll take a walk through the Python Data Dashboarding ecosystem, introducing its most prominent players and showcasing how a Jupyter Notebook analysis can be transformed into interactive dashboards using each tool. Through a systematic comparison, we delve into each framework's strengths, weaknesses, and diverse applications.";b.detailed_description="Nearly any Python library has the capability to generate static visual outputs such as PNGs, SVGs, HTML files, that can be copy-pasted into presentations, emails or published as figures in papers.\r\n\r\nHowever, in today's data-driven landscape, there's a growing need for dynamic, Python-backed applications that users can interact with in real-time to explore and analyze data. Fortunately, Python offers a rich ecosystem of tools to fulfill this demand. Among the top contenders for building web-based data dashboards are:\r\n\r\n1. [Dash] (developed by Plotly)\r\n2. [Panel] (developed by Anaconda)\r\n3. [Voila] (developed by QuantStack)\r\n4. [Streamlit]\r\n\r\n[Dash]: https:\u002F\u002Fdash.plotly.com\u002F\r\n[Panel]: https:\u002F\u002Fpanel.holoviz.org\u002F\r\n[Voila]: https:\u002F\u002Fvoila.readthedocs.io\u002Fen\u002Fstable\u002F#\r\n[Streamlit]: https:\u002F\u002Fstreamlit.io\u002F\r\n\r\nWe'll start with a Jupyter notebook containing data analysis and visualization code for the dataset on visitors to Taiwan. For each of the four frameworks—Dash, Panel, Voila, and Streamlit—we'll give a brief overview of how this Jupyter notebook can be translated into a dashboard. For instance, we'll see how Voila directly converts the notebook into a dashboard, while Streamlit utilizes built-in visualization components.\r\n\r\nWe will demonstrate pre-built dashboards to illustrate the capabilities of each framework.\r\n\r\nAfter introducing each framework, we will move on to a comprehensive comparison of the frameworks. This comparison will cover various parameters, such as graphing library support, Jupyter Notebook integration, ease-of-use, maturity, and popularity. Additionally, we will discuss the compatibility and integration of these frameworks with AI, big data analytics, and real-time visualization, providing insights into how each tool can be leveraged for advanced data applications.\r\n\r\nEach framwork has its merits and drawbacks, and your choice will not depend on choosing the absolute ‘best’, but rather on choosing the one that best fits your needs.";b.slide_link=a;b.slido_embed_link=a;b.hackmd_embed_link=a;b.speakers=[{thumbnail_url:"https:\u002F\u002Ftw.pycon.org\u002Fprs\u002Fmedia\u002Fcache\u002F1b\u002Fab\u002F1bab1623614510aecb063b955903c125.jpg",name:"Navya Agarwal",github_profile_url:"https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fnavyagarwal",twitter_profile_url:"https:\u002F\u002Ftwitter.com\u002FNavya_Agarwal_",facebook_profile_url:a,bio:"Navya Agarwal is a 21-year-old Computer Science student based out of Delhi, India.
