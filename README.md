## Set up a Development Environment

#### Requirements
- node >= 12.20.2
> You can refer to `package.json` file for more details.

#### Method 1: `Develop on your local machine`
1. Clone this repository.
2. Add Environment Variables to configure this project:
```bash
BUILD_TARGET=server                                                   
HOST=127.0.0.1

```
3. Install dependencies:

- Also, we have mock server to handle API on local:

# You need to add Environment Variables(Step.2). Otherwise, some of the pages may not work correctly.
npm run json-server
```

#### Method 2: `Run Development Server with Docker`

1. Clone this repository.
2. Simply run the docker-compose commands to launch or stop the mock API server & the dev server:


```bash
# Launch the dev server and the mock API server
docker-compose -f ./docker-compose-dev.yml up

# Stop the dev server and the mock API server
docker-compose -f ./docker-compose-dev.yml down
```
